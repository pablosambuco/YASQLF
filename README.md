# YASQLF: Yet Another SQL Formatter

I got tired of not being able to format SQL code in a simple, free, and customizable way in VSCode, so I decided to create my own code formatter.
Despite never having developed an extension or knowing TypeScript, this is my attempt.

## Features

SQL formatting following my own standard, derived from +15 years of work as a programmer on mainframe, Windows, and Linux

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1
